Linked Open Data is a way of publishing structured data that allows metadata to be connected and enriched, so that different representations of the same content can be found, and links made between related resources.

The metadata for all the objects in the Europeana portal is open, in that it is all licensed under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication under the terms of the Data Exchange Agreement (DEA), and can be freely downloaded via the API.

In October 2012, a large subset of this data was transformed into linked data and made available from data.europeana.eu. The data is represented in the Europeana Data Model (EDM). For more information, see out datasets page.

data.europeana.eu started as an experimental pilot in February 2012 with a small number of data providers who committed at an early stage to Europeana's initiative of promoting more open data. The current version of the pilot contains metadata on 20 milion texts, images, videos and sounds gathered by Europeana. They cover a great variety of heritage objects, such as this Slovenian version of "O Sole Mio" from the Nation Library of Slovenia, or Neil Robson's memories of the herring business from the Tyne and Wear Archives & Museums.
