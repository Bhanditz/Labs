The Linked Open Data pilot would not exist without the providers who volunteered to share their Europeana data. Please take the time to check out the list of collections currently included in the pilot.

Coordination and core implementation of data.europeana.eu are carried out by Bernhard Haslhofer and Antoine Isaac, with the support of the EuropeanaConnect project and Cesare Concordia at ISTI. We also want to thank:

Mary Rowlatt - contact with providers
Adam Horvath - semantic linking
Victor de Boer, Jacco van Ossenbruggen, Jan Wielemaker, Steffen Hennicke, Carlo Meghini, Tsuyoshi Sugibuchi, Go Sugimoto - EDM testing and ESE2EDM mapping
Stefan Gradmann - continuous lobbying to make the pilot happen :-)
