###Why is Linked Open Data important for Europeana and its community?

Linked Data offers many opportunities to the cultural sector, as suggested in the recent [reports](href="http://www.w3.org/News/2011.html#entry-9239)from the W3C Library Linked Data incubator group and our own [animation](http://vimeo.com/36752317).

Releasing Europeana metadata as Linked Open Data is an important step for Europeana, its partners and third parties. Linked Open Data has a key role in the [Europeana Strategic Plan 2011-2015](http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c4f19464-7504-44db-ac1e-3ddb78c922d7&amp;groupId=10602)&nbsp; and supports the idea that Europeana 'distributes' content and 'engages' its users:

*Distribute*: the pilot will allow Europeana to distribute the cultural heritage content, in order to <em>â€˜Make their heritage available to users wherever they are, whenever they want it'.

*Engage*: it will also enhance the engagement of the different communities represented by Europeana's content by allowing re-use and connectivity.

How can data.europeana.eu contribute to these goals ?

First, Linked Data is a data-publishing technique that enables related data to be connected and makes it easily accessible using common Web technologies. See this [White Paper](http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=cb417911-1ee0-473b-8840-bd7c6e9c93ae&groupId=10602)for further discussion on the scientific interest of Linked Data for the Europeana community.

Second, Linked Open Data realises this in an <i>open</i> manner, where everyone can access, re-use, enrich and share the data published. See this [business document](http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=374c381f-a48b-4cf0-bbde-172cf03672a2&groupId=10602) for further explanation on why Europeana and its partners should open the metadata they gather from all around Europe, and the [Support for open data](http://pro.europeana.eu/support-for-open-data) section of our site for general information on Europeana's efforts. You may also be interested in this [paper](http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2012/papers/sharing_cultural_heritage_the_linked_open_data)at Museum &amp; the Web that gives interesting context and pointers to current Linked Open Data developments.

###What does our Linked Open Data look like?
The data served by data.europeana.eu is generated from the metadata Europeana has harvested using the Europeana Semantic Elements (ESE)(http://pro.europeana.eu/technical-requirements)</a>. To make this data amenable to Linked Data publishing, we have converted it to the [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) format, and structured it using the [Europeana Data Model](http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation). We give more detail on the EDM data we publish on the [technical details page](http://pro.europeana.eu/technical-requirements).

In addition to the original data harvested by Europeana from its data providers, the data served at data.europeana.eu includes:

* links to other Linked Open Data services which hold information about objects that are also served by data.europeana.eu: for the moment this only concerns the Swedish cultural heritage aggregator (SOCH)
	
* semantic enrichment done at the Europeana Office, connecting Europeana objects to structured representations of places (using [GeoNames](http://geonames.org), concepts (using the [GEMET](http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet)thesaurus), people (using [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org)) and time periods(from an adhoc time period vocabulary).
