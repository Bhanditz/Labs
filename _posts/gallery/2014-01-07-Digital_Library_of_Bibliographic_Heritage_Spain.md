As part of HISPANA, the Digital Library of Bibliographic Heritage has chosen to use the Europeana API to complement results in their own search services with relevant links from Europeana.

The Digital Library of Bibliographic Heritage (Biblioteca Virtual de Patrimonio Bibliogr√°fico) is a joint project of the Ministry of Culture and the Autonomous Communities of Spain. Its objective is the digital dissemination of manuscript collections and printed books which are part of the Spanish Historical Heritage.
