The portal of the Swedish National Heritage Board (SOCH) www.kringla.nu allows users to search in both the national heritage repository 'SOCH' and Europeana presenting the search results in different tabs. 

Since SOCH is an aggregator for Europeana, their own objects in Europeana are filtered out of the API responses in order to avoid duplicate hits.
