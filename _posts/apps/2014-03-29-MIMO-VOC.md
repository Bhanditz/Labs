**MIMO-VOC: A multilingual vocabulary management tool** - This tool was developed as part of the [MIMO Project](http://www.mimo-project.eu/)(Musical Instrument Museums Online). 

MIMO-VOC manages two thesauri:
* a 3-level hierarchy of musical instrument classes that contains keywords in 6 languages for the general public
* a professional classification for organologists - The Hornbostel and Sax Classification

All the links associated with a given term (between terms of a given thesaurus or between terms of different thesauri) are graphically represented by the tool and allow for smooth navigation between them. All MIMO partners use the tool to translate terms and add synonyms in their own language. The vocabulary is then used for data enrichment as part of the MIMO-DB. This is key for a successful multilingual search.</p>
