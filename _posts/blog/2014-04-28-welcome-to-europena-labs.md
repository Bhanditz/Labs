This new Europeana Labs site is intended to provide all you need to get started using the Europeana API. Learn about the data, see what others have built, and find out how to build simple but powerful queries to extract bespoke results from a dataset of over 30 million openly licensed media objects - books, photos of art and artefacts, audio clips and more.

Last year we consulted with the developer community asking them what things would help them to make best use of the Europeana API. This Earopeana Labs Beta site is the first major step towards putting in place the things we were told, but also a chance for us to learn more and make improvements before a full launch in late June.

## Take a look around

We’ve pulled together some great examples of both content and existing applications to give you a real taste for what is possible. 

Take a look at the sample <a href="/data/" title="Europeana Data">Data</a>, chosen to highlight a wide range of content types and themes, such as photographs, maps and natural history. Each dataset gives you the chance to view the items in the Europeana Portal, but also to explore and edit the underlying query via the API Console.  

If you need inspiration than to explore our <a href="/apps/" title="Application Gallery">Application Gallery</a> showcasing innovative projects that have already been built using the Europeana platform.

You’ll also find details of <a href="/locations/" title="Europeana Locations">Locations</a>, hubs across Europe which offer online and real world places where you can go to play, develop, test and build.

But wherever you are, whatever your skills, and no matter what you're planning, don't be afraid to <a href="#help" title="help &amp; support">ask for help</a> as we're here to support you.

##API Documentation
Once you have an idea and you want to start building your application, head to our comprehensive <a href="/api/" title="API Documentation">online documentation</a>. It covers both the REST API and Linked Open Data, with extensive examples illustrating methods, syntax, and responses.

You can also use the <a href="/api/console/" title="API Concole"> to build and test anything from the simplest search to a complex query using facets such as dates, geotags and permissions.

<a name="start"></a>
## Getting started
Even if you’re new to Europeana, getting started is simple.
1. <a href="/api/registration/">Register for an API key</a>
2. Use the [API Console] to explore the content and customise queries. If you need help or inspiration, check out the example [Datasets] and consult our extensive [API documentation].
3. Build your application. If you don’t know where to start, check out our [Application Gallery] - many applications have public code repositories and there’s also a [Java library] and [Python wrapper] available. Please be sure though to check licensing conditions before use {do we need to say this? sounds a bit negative}.
