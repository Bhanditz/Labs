This new Europeana Labs site is intended to provide all you need to get started using the Europeana API, and quickly progress to building simple but powerful queries to extract bespoke results from a dataset of over 30 million openly licensed media objects - books, photos of art and artefacts, audio clips and more.

## Take a look around
We’ve pulled together some great examples of both content and existing applications to give you a real taste for what is possible. 

Take a look at the sample [Datasets] which show a wide range of content types and themes, such as photographs, maps and natural history. Each dataset gives you the chance to view the items in the Portal, but also to explore and edit the underlying query via the API Console. You’ll also find details of [Spaces], hubs across Europe which offer online and real world places where you can go to play, develop, test and build. Finally, what better way to get inspiration than to explore our [Application Gallery], showcasing some innovative projects that have already been built using the Europeana platform.

## Getting started
Even if you’re new to Europeana or even using similar APIs, getting started is simple.
1. [Register for an API key]
2. Use the [API Console] to explore the content and customise queries. If you need help or inspiration, check out the example [Datasets] and consult our extensive [API documentation].
3. Build your application. If you don’t know where to start, check out our [Application Gallery] - many applications have public code repositories and there’s also a [Java library] and [Python wrapper] available. Please be sure though to check licensing conditions before use {do we need to say this? sounds a bit negative}.


## Need help?
There are lots of ways you can get help using the Europeana API. You can contact us directly via our [contact form] or at api@europeana.eu. There’s also an [API Forum] where you can chat with other developers and you can [follow @EuropeanaTech] on Twitter.
