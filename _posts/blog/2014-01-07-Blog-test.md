CARARE Map is a web-based mapping tool for archaeological/architectural sites.

CARARE Map is a web-based mapping tool for archaeological/architectural sites. Through the Europeana API, it supports navigation and search in 2 million digital heritage sites objects available on CARARE repository and Europeana. Users can filter the heritage content on the map based on a keyword (also in various languages) or a geographical location. They can choose their preferred map layer (Open Street Map, Google Physical/Satellite/Streets/Hybrid) and plan their own cultural route by clicking selected points on the map and ending the route by double-click.
