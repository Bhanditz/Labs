To perform general API calls, like search, object or provider/collection, which do not involve user-specific information, the most basic authentication scheme is used. For accessing user-specific data stored on MyEuropeana accounts using MyData calls, a caller application is to be identified by the user credentials. Finally, for applications wishing to get 3rd party access on behalf of a registered user, OAuth2 authentication scheme is supported. This is the simplest form of authentication which does not involve accessing user-specific information. To perform a call using this authentication every API call must be provided a special authentication parameter wskey. This value of this parameter should be the private key that you got during the API user registration process. We use these keys to anonymously gather interesting statistics about API usage. This form of authentication is used when an application wishes to access MyEuropeana data of a specific user and the public and the private keys of this user are known available in advance. In this case login is done by calling a POST method with the following two parameters that contain authentication credentials: When a login is successful a status 200 is returned, otherwise a redirect to the login page is triggered. For applications that wish to access MyEuropeana data of a specific end-user on his behalf, we use the standard OAuth2 authentication scheme. This scheme works by redirecting the application to a dedicated login page provided by the server and issuing to the application an authenticating token with a limited lifetime when the login is succesful. The token can be refreshed later on by the application. To use this kind of authentication the application should first access the URL and further on the URL to refresh the token. There are many open source libraries available for various languages to help you implement this authentication scheme in your project. For more information, consult the OAuth2 reference page.","tags":[],"imageurl":[""],"excerpt":""},{"title":"Get your API key","url":"/api/registration/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"Sign up for your free API key and get developing!

A detailed description of EDM is beyond the scope of this documentation: the reader is referred to the extensive documentation on Europeana website. However, a basic understanding of the data organization is necessary for implementing the API. The objective of this section is to provide this basic understanding. Europeana API provides access to the Europeana repository, which is modeled using EDM. While EDM is an open flexible data model featuring various kind of resources and relations between them, the Europeana API (and the Europeana portal) supports the retrieval of a defined subgraph of EDM for expository purposes. These ‘atomic’ EDM subgraphs usually contain one cultural heritage object (CHO), the aggregation information which connects the metadata and the digital representations together and a number of contextual resources such as the agents, places, concepts and time pertaining to the CHO. The further API documentation, in particular the /record call refers to this subgraph as object. Digital records delivered to Europeana are assigned a unique identifier, Europeana ID, that serves to further identify the records when using the API. Usually, this identifier is based on the original metadata that are provided for the record and internal Europeana identifiers of the provider and the dataset containing the record. For example, a Europeana ID of an object can look as follows: where 091 is the identifier of the provider, 02 is the id of the dataset and GNM1234_ is derived from the unique identifier of the record in the context of the provider. Europeana data is organized in records which correspond to cultural heritage objects. Each object is described by a number of fields in the record which contain information such as the title of the object, its description, the date, persons and concepts related to it. Europeana aggregates its data from cultural institutions that can use diverse, fine-grained systems and methodologies. As a result, a link between for example an object and a person may be stored in different specialized fields. To provide simpler views on this data, Europeana has introduced several general Aggregated Fields: title, who, what, when, and where. In these fields we gather together information from different record fields in order to make the discovery of objects easier. Title, for example, aggregates data from the dc:title and dcterms:alternative fields which are part of Dublin Core, a popular general standard for describing different types of resources. The number of records that Europeana contains is very big and growing. Therefore we need efficient ways to allow our users to discover what they need easily. One such technique is a faceted indexing system that classifies each record along multiple dimensions. The facets, seen on the left side of the Europeana portal, can be useful for filtering search results and can also be used by API users. Currently we support the following facets:","tags":[],"imageurl":[""],"excerpt":""},{"title":"API Console","url":"/api/console/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"","tags":[],"imageurl":[""],"excerpt":""},{"title":"Europeana REST API","url":"/api/portal-api/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"The Europeana REST API allows you to build applications that use the wealth of cultural heritage objects stored in the Europeana repository. The API uses the standard web technology of REST calls over HTTP. Responses are returned in the popular JSON format. To get straight to the point of the API, you can go directly to the Essentials page which tells you only what you have to know to start using the API. To start using the API you should register at the registration page. Upon registration you will get your individual private authentication key. This key should be used when calling API methods as a special wskey authentication parameter. The current version of the Europeana API (API2) is fully backward compatible with the previous version (API1). However, we encourage developers to switch to the new naming of the fields that were used in API1. For more information on the mapping between the new and the old fields, please see API1-API2 Fields Mapping. There is a method for developers to see how Europeana API works and test it for their needs without getting registered - the API console. This is an interactive tool that allows filling method parameters in an online form and see both the expected results and the exact format of the call that should be used by an application to get these results. The API console has been built by us for developers’ convenience. You are encouraged to use it and provide us feedback about its usability for the developer community. Join the Europeana API discussion group at Google Groups and get regular updates about the Europeana API, provide feedback and discuss it with other developer.

Learn about the data, see what others have built, and find out how to build simple but powerful queries to extract bespoke results from a dataset of over 30 million openly licensed media objects - books, photos of art and artefacts, audio clips and more. Last year we consulted with the developer community asking them what things would help them to make best use of the Europeana API. This Earopeana Labs Beta site is the first major step towards putting in place the things we were told, but also a chance for us to learn more and make improvements before a full launch in late June. We’ve pulled together some great examples of both content and existing applications to give you a real taste for what is possible. Take a look at the sample Data, chosen to highlight a wide range of content types and themes, such as photographs, maps and natural history. Each dataset gives you the chance to view the items in the Europeana Portal, but also to explore and edit the underlying query via the API Console. If you need inspiration explore our Application Gallery showcasing innovative projects that have already been built using the Europeana platform. You’ll also find details of Locations, hubs across Europe which offer online and real world places where you can go to play, develop, test and build. But wherever you are, whatever your skills, and no matter what you’re planning, don’t be afraid to ask for help as we’re here to support you. Once you have an idea and you want to start building your application, head to our comprehensive online documentation. It covers both the REST API and Linked Open Data, with extensive examples illustrating methods, syntax, and responses. You can also use the API Console to build and test anything from the simplest search to a complex query using facets such as dates, geotags and permissions. Even if you’re new to Europeana, getting started is simple. There are lots of ways you can get help using the Europeana API. You can contact us directly via our [contact form] or at api@europeana.eu. If you want to chat with fellow developers head over to the API Forum on Google Groups and you can also follow @EuropeanaTech on Twitter. The Labs site is currently in beta, with a full launch planned in late June. We’d love to have your feedback on the site and what you think works, and what needs improvements. We’re also happy to hear of any ideas you have. Please take a few minutes to fill out our simple survey and tell us what you think.","tags":["Introduction","Beta"],"imageurl":"/img/blog/140328-introduction-blog-post.jpg","excerpt":"<p>This new Europeana Labs site is intended to provide all you need to get started using the Europeana API.
