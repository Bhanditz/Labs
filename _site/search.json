A detailed description of EDM is beyond the scope of this documentation: the reader is referred to the extensive documentation on Europeana website. However, a basic understanding of the data organization is necessary for implementing the API. The objective of this section is to provide this basic understanding. Digital records delivered to Europeana are assigned a unique identifier, Europeana ID, that serves to further identify the records when using the API. Usually, this identifier is based on the original metadata that are provided for the record and internal Europeana identifiers of the provider and the dataset containing the record. For example, a Europeana ID of an object can look as follows: where 091 is the identifier of the provider, 02 is the id of the dataset and GNM1234_ is derived from the unique identifier of the record in the context of the provider. Europeana data is organized in records which correspond to cultural heritage objects. Each object is described by a number of fields in the record which contain information such as the title of the object, its description, the date, persons and concepts related to it. Europeana aggregates its data from cultural institutions that can use diverse, fine-grained systems and methodologies. As a result, a link between for example an object and a person may be stored in different specialized fields. To provide simpler views on this data, Europeana has introduced several general Aggregated Fields: title, who, what, when, and where. In these fields we gather together information from different record fields in order to make the discovery of objects easier. Title, for example, aggregates data from the dc:title and dcterms:alternative fields which are part of Dublin Core, a popular general standard for describing different types of resources. The number of records that Europeana contains is very big and growing. Therefore we need efficient ways to allow our users to discover what they need easily. One such technique is a faceted indexing system that classifies each record along multiple dimensions. The facets, seen on the left side of the Europeana portal, can be useful for filtering search results and can also be used by API users. Currently we support the following facets:","tags":[]},{"title":"API Authentication","url":"/api/authentication/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"Every API call must be provided a special authentication parameter wskey.

The API uses the standard web technology of REST calls over HTTP. Responses are returned in the popular JSON format for data exchange. To get straight to the point of the API, you can go directly to the Essentials page which tells you only what you have to know to start using the API. To start using the API you should register at the registration page. Upon registration you will get your individual private authentication key. This key should be used when calling API methods as a special wskey authentication parameter. The current version of the Europeana API (API2) is fully backward compatible with the previous version (API1). However, we encourage developers to switch to the new naming of the fields that were used in API1. For more information on the mapping between the new and the old fields, please see API1-API2 Fields Mapping. There is a method for developers to see how Europeana API works and test it for their needs without getting registered - the API console. This is an interactive tool that allows filling method parameters in an online form and see both the expected results and the exact format of the call that should be used by an application to get these results. The API console has been built by us for developers’ convenience. You are encouraged to use it and provide us feedback about its usability for the developer community.

The provided methods are the same, with a path difference in the url’s. OAuth2 is a token based authentication and authorisation system where your user gets redirected to a login page on our server. After the login page the user have to give permition to give access to the users data. On both steps succesfully finished, the API server redirects back to a given url with an access token which can be used to access or modify data on our servers. The access token has a limited time life, but can be refreshed with a refresh token also given by the authorisation process. This two url’s are important for the process: There are many open source libraries available for a big variation of languages to help you implement this into your own project. See the page mentioned below for more information and a list of libraries. More information: OAuth.net/2/. MyData methods use your public and private api keys to authenticate. Logging in is done by send a POST request to the following url and use the described parameters filled with the combination of both API keys. For a succesfull login, you should get a status 200 back, otherwise it will trigger a redirect to a login html page. This can be ignored, the login page is for testing purposes only.
