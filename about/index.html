	<p>Use our API for your own developments and mash-ups, or visit our physical 'hubs' - playgrounds for using and experimenting with digital collections from Europe's museums, galleries, libraries and archives.</p>

	<p>With the Europeana API, you can access the collections and incorporate them into things like apps, games, websites, even creating mash-ups using other APIs. The possibilities really are endless.</p>

	<p>Here we highlight just some of the collections you can find through Europeana - explore them through the <a href="http://europeana.eu" title="Europeana search portal">Europeana portal</a> or directly through the <a href="http://europeana.eu/portal/api/console.html" title="Test the Europeana API using a console">API console</a>.</p>
