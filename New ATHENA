New ATHENA is a new project developing metadata exchange standards for the museum domain and aggregating museum content for Europeana. Through our API, they have built a search service where users can perform keyword searches and structured searches to find and view Europeana items. 

[Example: search for the famous photographer, Man Ray.](http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=man+ray "Search for the photographer Man Ray")
